/**
 * The alternative to `React.useReducer` that lets you control the state from the outside.
 *
 * It can be used in an uncontrolled mode, similar to `React.useReducer`, or in a controlled mode, when the state is controlled by the props.
 * It also supports partially controlled state, when some state items are controlled and some are not.
 *
 * The controlled state items are provided via the `controlledProps` parameter.
 * When a reducer action is dispatched, the internal state is updated with the new values.
 * A change event (`onStateChange`) is then triggered (for each changed state item) if the new state is different from the previous state.
 * This event can be used to update the controlled values.
 *
 * The comparison of the previous and next states is done using the `stateComparers` parameter.
 * If a state item has a corresponding comparer, it will be used to determine if the state has changed.
 * This is useful when the state item is an object and you want to compare only a subset of its properties or if it's an array and you want to compare its contents.
 *
 * An additional feature is the `actionContext` parameter. It allows you to add additional properties to every action object,
 * similarly to how React context is implicitly available to every component.
 *
 * @template State - The type of the state calculated by the reducer.
 * @template Action - The type of the actions that can be dispatched.
 * @template ActionContext - The type of the additional properties that will be added to every action object.
 *
 * @ignore - internal hook.
