/**
 * Combines the two get*Props functions from Base UI hooks into one.
 * Useful when a hook uses two other hooks behind the scenes
 * (such as useSelect that depends on useList and useButton for its root slot).
 *
 * The resulting function will return the combined props.
 * They are merged from left to right, similarly to how Object.assign works.
 *
 * The getSecondProps function will receive the result of the getFirstProps function as its argument,
 * so its event handlers can call the previous handlers and act depending on its result.
 *
 * @param getFirstProps - A getter function that returns the props for the first slot. It receives the external event handlers as its argument.
 * @param getSecondProps - A getter function that returns the props for the second slot. It receives the result of the getFirstProps function as its argument.
