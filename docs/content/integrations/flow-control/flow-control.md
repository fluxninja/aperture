Flow control in Aperture refers to the mechanism of regulating the flow of
requests in a web-scale application to ensure stability and reliability.
Aperture uses a combination of techniques such as weighted fair queuing,
distributed rate-limiting, and prioritization of critical features to manage the
flow of requests and prevent overloading. It also uses circuit-driven policies
and a programmable, high-fidelity flow classifier to make decisions about how to
handle requests and prioritize workloads.

## Setup

Aperture can interface with service instances through _Service Meshes_ or
_SDKs_:

- Service Meshes: Aperture can be deployed with no changes to application code,
  using [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). It latches onto Envoyâ€™s
  [External Authorization API](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_authz_filter)
  for control purposes and collects access logs for telemetry purposes. On each
  request, Envoy sends request metadata to the Aperture Agent for a flow control
  decision. Inside the Aperture Agent, the request traverses classifiers,
  rate-limiters, and schedulers, before the decision to accept or drop the
  request is sent back to Envoy. Aperture participates in the
  [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) tracing protocol as it inserts flow
  classification labels into requests, enabling visualization in tracing tools
  such as [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/).
- Aperture SDKs: In addition to service mesh insertion, Aperture provides SDKs
  that can be used by developers to achieve fine-grained flow control at the
  feature level inside service code. For example, an e-commerce app might want
  to prioritize users in the checkout flow over new sessions when the
  application is experiencing an overload. The Aperture Controller can be
  programmed to degrade features as an escalated recovery action when basic load
  shedding is triggered for several minutes.
- API Gateways: Aperture seamlessly integrates with various API gateways,
  including [Kong](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/) and
  [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/api-gateway/), enabling easy
  integration with a diverse range of gateways. This integration at the gateway
  level simplifies traffic flow management before it reaches the main
  application. Prior to forwarding a request to the upstream service, the API
  gateway transmits request metadata to the Aperture Agent for flow control
  decision-making. Within the Aperture Agent, the request undergoes
  classification, rate-limiting, and scheduling processes, culminating in a
  decision to accept or drop the request, which is then relayed back to the API
  gateway.
