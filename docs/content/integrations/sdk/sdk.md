For services to control flows with Aperture Agent, [Control
Points][control-point] must be set within the service.

This can be achieved in the following ways:

- [Istio/Envoy integration][istio] for controlling HTTP or gRPC requests flowing
  through the service.
- Aperture SDKs can be used to set feature or traffic (HTTP and gRPC) control
  points within the service code. This approach allows for fine-grained flow
  control.

<a

SDKs</a> available for popular languages, such as :-

- [Golang][golang]
- [Java][java]
- [JavaScript][javascript]
- [Python][python]

Aperture SDK allows you to manually wrap any function call or code snippet
inside the service code as a feature control point. Every invocation of the
feature is a flow from the perspective of Aperture.

## ðŸ§© Middleware

Aperture includes middleware for the following frameworks, helping to set up
control points with less code changes:

- [Armeria][armeria]
- [Netty][netty]
- [Tomcat][tomcat]
- [Spring Boot][spring-boot]
