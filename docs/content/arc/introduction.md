[FluxNinja ARC][] (Application Reliability Center) is a cloud reliability
platform for your applications and infrastructure. It provides a hassle-free
experience and offers a unified solution for managing all tasks related to
reliability. Regardless of whether your applications are hosted on your own
bare-metal servers or in the cloud, the only requirement is to install Agents
and set up integrations. This allows you to start implementing policies to
control your traffic.

[Aperture][], the core component of FluxNinja ARC, empowers you to manage your
load effectively by classifying, scheduling, and rate-limiting API traffic in
cloud applications.
