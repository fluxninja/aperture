Resources configuration in the policy specification describes resources needed
to set up a [circuit][circuit]. It's possible but not recommended to share
resources across policies since resources are always defined in the global
scope. Resources may be referenced inside the circuit, the exact reference
mechanism depends on the type of resource.

Examples:

1. [_Flux Meters_][flux-meter]: The metrics generated by a _Flux Meter_ may be
   referenced inside [PromQL components][promql-reference]
2. [_Classifiers_][classifier]: The labels generated by a _Classifier_ may be
   referred inside a [`FlowSelector`][selector-reference].
