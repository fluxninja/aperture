<!-- Resources needed to support a Circuit -->

:::info

See also [Resources reference](/reference/configuration/policies.md#v1-resources)

:::

Resources section in Policy describes resources needed to set up a Circuit. It's
possible but not recommended to share Resources across Policies since Resources
are always defined in the global scope. Resources may be referenced inside the
Circuit, the exact reference mechanism depends on the type of Resource.

The following are the available Resource types

1. [FluxMeters][flux-meter]: The metrics generated by FluxMeter may be
   referenced inside [PromQL Components][promql-reference]
2. [Flow Classifiers][flow-classifier]: The labels generate by Classifiers may
   be referred inside [Selectors][selector-reference].

[flux-meter]: /concepts/flow-control/flux-meter.md
[flow-classifier]: /concepts/flow-control/flow-classifier.md
[promql-reference]: /reference/configuration/policies.md#v1-prom-q-l
[selector-reference]: /reference/configuration/policies.md#v1-selector
