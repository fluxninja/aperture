:::info what's a flow?

A flow is the fundamental unit of work from the perspective of an Aperture
Agent. It could be an API call, a feature, or even a database query. A flow in
Aperture is similar to [OpenTelemetry span][span].

:::

Every flow is annotated with a set of **Flow Labels**. Each _Flow Label_ is a
key:value pair. If a flow is annotated with `user_tier:gold` label, then
`user_tier` is a label key and `gold` is a label value.

_Flow Labels_ are used in different ways in Aperture:

- The [_Flow Selector_][flow-selector] can select flows based on _Flow Labels_,
  to narrow the scope of [_Classifiers_][classifier], [_Flux
  Meters_][flux-meter] and so on.
- Map a flow to a [_Workload_][workload].
- Fairness within [_Scheduler_][scheduler] and [_Rate Limiter_][ratelimiter]
  keys are also based on _Flow Labels_.

## Sources

Flows are annotated with _Flow Labels_ based on four sources: request labels,
baggage, flow classifiers, and explicit labels from the Aperture SDK call.

### Request labels

For each HTTP [_Control Point_][control-point] (where flows are HTTP or GRPC
requests), some basic metadata is available as _request labels_. These are
`http.method`, `http.target`, `http.host`, `http.scheme`,
`http.request_content_length` and `http.flavor`. Additionally, all (non-pseudo)
headers are available as `http.request.header.header_name`, e.g.
`http.request.header.user_agent` (note the `snake_case`!). The values of these
labels are described by [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for HTTP
spans][otel-conventions]. The only exception is the `http.host` attribute, which
is equal to the host or authority header. This is similar to the `net.peer.name`
OTel attribute.

### Baggage {#baggage}

Baggage propagation is a powerful concept that allows attaching metadata to a
whole request chain or to a whole [trace][traces]. If you already have baggage
propagation configured in your system, you can access the baggage as flow
labels. This is supported on service-mesh (Envoy) and web framework-based
control point insertion.

- _HTTP_: Baggage is pulled from the [_baggage_][baggage] header.
- _Feature_: Baggage is automatically pulled from context on each `Check()`
  call. This is assuming you're using the OpenTelemetry library to manage the
  baggage.

Baggage members are mapped to _Flow Labels_ 1:1â€“keys become label keys, values
become label values (properties are ignored).

Read more about baggage propagation on:
[Baggage | OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/baggage/).

### Classifiers

When the labels you need aren't already present in baggage, nor as request
labels, you can create a [_Classifier_][classifier] to inject new labels into
the system. Since the Classifier also injects the label into baggage by default,
this means you can set or extract the label in a different place than where it
is consumed (assuming you have baggage propagation configured throughout your
system).

### Aperture SDKs

The Aperture SDKs, in addition to automatically using baggage from context, also
takes an explicit `labels` map in the `Check()` call.

## Live Previewing Flow Labels

You can discover the labels flowing through services and control points using
[`aperturectl`][aperturectl].

For example:

```sh
aperturectl flow-control preview --kube service1-demo-app.demoapp.svc.cluster.local ingress
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "samples": [
    {
      "labels": {
        "http.flavor": "1.1",
        "http.host": "service1-demo-app.demoapp.svc.cluster.local",
        "http.method": "POST",
        "http.request.header.content_length": "201",
        "http.request.header.content_type": "application/json",
        "http.request.header.cookie": "session=eyJ1c2VyIjoia2Vub2JpIn0.YbsY4Q.kTaKRTyOIfVlIbNB48d9YH6Q0wo",
        "http.request.header.user_agent": "k6/0.42.0 (https://k6.io/)",
        "http.request.header.user_id": "14",
        "http.request.header.user_type": "bot",
        "http.request.header.x_forwarded_proto": "http",
        "http.request.header.x_request_id": "3958dad8-eb71-47f0-a9f6-500cccb097d2",
        "http.request_content_length": "0",
        "http.scheme": "http",
        "http.target": "/request",
        "user_type": "bot"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the
[Introspection API](reference/api/agent/flow-preview-service-preview-flow-labels.api.mdx)
directly on a `aperture-agent` local to the service instances (pods):

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:8080/v1/flowcontrol/preview/labels/service1-demo-app.demoapp.svc.cluster.local/ingress?samples=1
```

## Telemetry

Telemetry data is extracted out of flows for further processing. This data is
collected from the following sources:

- Stream of access logs from service mesh (refer to [Istio
  Configuration][istio])
- Traces from [Aperture SDK][aperture-go]

Aperture uses OpenTelemetry's robust pipelines for receiving the telemetry data
and producing other streams of data from it.

### Metrics

Prometheus metrics are generated from the received telemetry data. Along the
path of the flows, telemetry data is tagged by the [Flux Meters][flux-meter] and
[workloads][workload] that matched.

### OLAP style telemetry

OLAP style telemetry data is generated as OpenTelemetry logs and is saved in an
OLAP database. This is done by creating multidimensional roll ups from flow
labels.

OLAP style telemetry does not work well with extremely high-cardinality labels,
therefore, if an extremely high-cardinality label is detected, some of its
values might be replaced with the `REDACTED_VIA_CARDINALITY_LIMIT` string.

#### Default labels

These are protocol-level labels (For example: HTTP, network) extracted by the
configured service mesh/middleware and are available to be referenced in [Flow
Matcher][flow-matcher], except for a few high-cardinality ones.

#### Labels extracted from baggage

These are _Flow Labels_ mapped from [baggage](#baggage).

#### Labels defined by user

These are labels provided by _Classifiers_ in case of service mesh/middleware
integration, or explicitly at flow creation in [Aperture SDK][aperture-go].

:::note

In the case of a clash, the _Flow Label_ will be applied in the following
precedence over:

1. User-defined
2. Baggage
3. Default

## Interaction with FluxNinja ARC Extension {#extension}

All the flow Labels are used as labels of flow events. These events are rolled
up and sent to the analytics database in the FluxNinja ARC. This allows:

- For the _Flow Labels_ to be used as filters or group-by
- To see analytics for each _Flow Label_, for example: distribution of its
  values

:::note

For _Classifier_ created labels, you can disable this behavior by setting
`hidden: true` in the [classification rule](/reference/policies/spec.md#rule).
