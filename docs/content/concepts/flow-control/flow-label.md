Every [Flow][flow] is annotated with a set of **flow labels**. Each flow label
is a key:value pair. If a Flow is annotated with `user_tier:gold` label, then
`user_tier` is a label key and `gold` is a label value.

Flow labels are used in different ways in Aperture:

- [Flow selector][selector] can select flows based on flow labels, thus flow
  labels can be used to narrow the scope of [Classifiers][classifier], Limiters
  or [_Flux Meters_][flux-meter]
- Flow labels are used to classify a flow to a [_workload_][workload]
- Fairness within a scheduler's workload and [rate-limiting][ratelimiter] keys
  are also based on flow labels

## Sources

Flows are annotated with flow labels based on four sources: request labels,
baggage, flow classifiers, and explicit labels from the Aperture SDK call.

### Request labels

For each _traffic_ [control point][control-point] (where flows are http or grpc
requests), some basic metadata is available as _request labels_. These are
`http.method` , `http.target`, `http.host`, `http.scheme`,
`http.request_content_length` and `http.flavor`. Additionally all (non-pseudo)
headers are available as `http.request.header.header_name`, eg.
`http.request.header.user_agent` (note the snake_case!). Values of these labels
are described by [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for HTTP
spans][otel-conventions]. The only exception is `http.host` attribute, which is
equal to Host/Authority header. This is thus similar to `net.peer.name` OTEL
attribute, but is provided for both ingress and egress control points.

### Baggage {#baggage}

Baggage propagation is a powerful concept that allows attaching metadata to a
whole request chain or to a whole [trace][traces]. If you already have baggage
propagation configured in your system, you can access the baggage as flow
labels. This is supported on both _traffic_ and _feature_ [control
points][control-point].

- _traffic_: Baggage is pulled from the [_baggage_][baggage] header
- _feature_: Baggage is automatically pulled from context on each `Check()`
  call. This is assuming you're using the OpenTelemetry library to manage the
  baggage

Baggage members are mapped to flow labels 1:1 â€“ keys become label keys, values
become label values (properties are ignored).

Read more about baggage propagation on:
[Baggage | OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/baggage/).

### Flow classifiers

When the labels you need are not already present in baggage, nor as request
labels, you can create a [classifier][classifier] to inject new labels into the
system. Since the classifier also injects the label into baggage by default,
this means you can set or extract the label in a different place than where it
is consumed (assuming you have baggage propagation configured throughout your
system).

### Aperture SDK

The Aperture SDK, in addition to automatically pulling baggage from context,
also takes an explicit `labels` map in the `Check()` call.

## Telemetry

Telemetry data is extracted out of flows for further processing. This data is
collected from the following sources:

- Stream of access logs from service mesh (refer to [Istio
  Configuration][istio])
- Traces from [Aperture SDK][aperture-go]

Aperture uses OpenTelemetry's robust pipelining for receiving the telemetry data
and produce other streams of data from it.

### Metrics

Prometheus metrics are generated from the telemetry data that is received. Along
the path of the [Flows][flow], telemetry data is tagged by the [flux
meters][flux-meter] and [workloads][workload] that matched.

### OLAP-style Telemetry

OLAP-style telemetry data is generated as OpenTelemetry logs and is saved in an
OLAP database. This is done by creating multi-dimensional rollups from flow
labels.

#### Default labels

These are protocol-level labels (e.g. http, network) extracted by the
configurated service mesh/middleware and are available to be referenced in
selectors, execept for a few high-cardinality ones.

#### Labels extracted from baggage

These are flow labels mapped from [baggage](#baggage).

#### Labels defined by user

These are labels provided via classifiers in case of service mesh/middleware
integration, or explicitly at [Flow][flow] creation in [Aperture
SDK][aperture-go].

:::note

In the case of a clash, the flow label generated from the source takes
predendence over the source below it:

1. User-defined
2. Baggage
3. Default

:::

## Interaction with FluxNinja Cloud plugin {#plugin}

All the flow labels are used as labels of flow events. These events are rolled
up and sent to the analytics database in the cloud. This allows:

- For the flow labels to be used as filters or group bys
- To see analytics for each flow label, eg. distribution of its values

:::note

For classifier-created labels, you can disable this behaviour by setting
`hidden: true` in
[the classification rule](/reference/configuration/policies.md#v1-rule).

:::

:::caution

This means that by default the already-present-in-baggage labels are sent to the
cloud. If this is not what you want,
[we'll be providing a way](https://github.com/fluxninja/aperture/issues/376) to
select which labels to include in telemetry.
