Every [Flow][flow] is annotated with a set of **Flow Labels**. Each Flow Label
is a key:value pair. If a Flow is annotated with `user_tier:gold` label, then
`user_tier` is a label key and `gold` is a label value.

Flow Labels are used in different ways in Aperture:

- [Flow Selector][flow-selector] can select flows based on Flow Labels, thus
  flow labels can be used to narrow the scope of [Classifiers][classifier],
  Limiters or [_Flux Meters_][flux-meter]
- Flow Labels are used to classify a flow to a [_workload_][workload]
- Fairness within a scheduler's workload and [rate-limiting][ratelimiter] keys
  are also based on Flow Labels

## Sources

Flows are annotated with Flow Labels based on four sources: request labels,
baggage, flow classifiers, and explicit labels from the Aperture SDK call.

### Request labels

For each _traffic_ [control point][control-point] (where flows are http or grpc
requests), some basic metadata is available as _request labels_. These are
`http.method` , `http.target`, `http.host`, `http.scheme`,
`http.request_content_length` and `http.flavor`. Additionally all (non-pseudo)
headers are available as `http.request.header.header_name`, e.g.
`http.request.header.user_agent` (note the snake_case!). Values of these labels
are described by [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for HTTP
spans][otel-conventions]. The only exception is `http.host` attribute, which is
equal to Host/Authority header. This is thus similar to `net.peer.name` OTEL
attribute.

### Baggage {#baggage}

Baggage propagation is a powerful concept that allows attaching metadata to a
whole request chain or to a whole [trace][traces]. If you already have baggage
propagation configured in your system, you can access the baggage as flow
labels. This is supported on service-mesh (Envoy) and web framework based
control point insertion.

- _traffic_: Baggage is pulled from the [_baggage_][baggage] header
- _feature_: Baggage is automatically pulled from context on each `Check()`
  call. This is assuming you're using the OpenTelemetry library to manage the
  baggage

Baggage members are mapped to Flow Labels 1:1 â€“ keys become label keys, values
become label values (properties are ignored).

Read more about baggage propagation on:
[Baggage | OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/baggage/).

### Flow Classifiers

When the labels you need are not already present in baggage, nor as request
labels, you can create a [classifier][classifier] to inject new labels into the
system. Since the Classifier also injects the label into baggage by default,
this means you can set or extract the label in a different place than where it
is consumed (assuming you have baggage propagation configured throughout your
system).

### Aperture SDK

The Aperture SDK, in addition to automatically pulling baggage from context,
also takes an explicit `labels` map in the `Check()` call.

## Live Previewing Flow Labels

You can discover the labels flowing through services and control points using
the
[Introspection API](references/api/agent/flow-preview-service-preview-flow-labels.api.mdx)
on an `aperture-agent` local to the service instances (pods).

For example:

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:8080/v1/flowcontrol/preview/labels/service1-demo-app.demoapp.svc.cluster.local/ingress?samples=1
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "samples": [
    {
      "labels": {
        "http.flavor": "1.1",
        "http.host": "service1-demo-app.demoapp.svc.cluster.local",
        "http.method": "POST",
        "http.request.header.content_length": "201",
        "http.request.header.content_type": "application/json",
        "http.request.header.cookie": "session=eyJ1c2VyIjoia2Vub2JpIn0.YbsY4Q.kTaKRTyOIfVlIbNB48d9YH6Q0wo",
        "http.request.header.user_agent": "k6/0.42.0 (https://k6.io/)",
        "http.request.header.user_id": "14",
        "http.request.header.user_type": "bot",
        "http.request.header.x_forwarded_proto": "http",
        "http.request.header.x_request_id": "3958dad8-eb71-47f0-a9f6-500cccb097d2",
        "http.request_content_length": "0",
        "http.scheme": "http",
        "http.target": "/request",
        "user_type": "bot"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Telemetry

Telemetry data is extracted out of flows for further processing. This data is
collected from the following sources:

- Stream of access logs from service mesh (refer to [Istio
  Configuration][istio])
- Traces from [Aperture SDK][aperture-go]

Aperture uses OpenTelemetry's robust pipelining for receiving the telemetry data
and produce other streams of data from it.

### Metrics

Prometheus metrics are generated from the telemetry data that is received. Along
the path of the [Flows][flow], telemetry data is tagged by the [flux
meters][flux-meter] and [workloads][workload] that matched.

### OLAP-style Telemetry

OLAP-style telemetry data is generated as OpenTelemetry logs and is saved in an
OLAP database. This is done by creating multi-dimensional rollups from flow
labels.

OLAP-style telemetry doesn't work well with high-cardinality labels, thus if
high-cardinality label is detected, some of its values may be replaced with
`REDACTED_VIA_CARDINALITY_LIMIT` string.

#### Default labels

These are protocol-level labels (e.g. http, network) extracted by the configured
service mesh/middleware and are available to be referenced in [Label
Matchers][label-matchers], except for a few high-cardinality ones.

#### Labels extracted from baggage

These are Flow Labels mapped from [baggage](#baggage).

#### Labels defined by user

These are labels provided via Classifiers in case of service mesh/middleware
integration, or explicitly at [Flow][flow] creation in [Aperture
SDK][aperture-go].

:::note

In the case of a clash, the Flow Label will be applied in the following
precedence over:

1. User-defined
2. Baggage
3. Default

## Interaction with FluxNinja ARC plugin {#plugin}

All the Flow Labels are used as labels of flow events. These events are rolled
up and sent to the analytics database in the FluxNinja ARC. This allows:

- For the Flow Labels to be used as filters or group bys
- To see analytics for each Flow Label, eg. distribution of its values

:::note

For Classifier-created labels, you can disable this behaviour by setting
`hidden: true` in
[the Classification rule](/references/configuration/policy.md#v1-rule).

:::

:::caution

This means that by default the already-present-in-baggage labels are sent to the
cloud. If this is not what you want,
[we'll be providing a way](https://github.com/fluxninja/aperture/issues/376) to
select which labels to include in telemetry.
