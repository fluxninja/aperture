:::info

See also [Classifier reference][reference]

:::

If existing [Flow Labels][label] are not sufficient, Flow Classifier can be used
to inject additional ones without any changes to your service.

A classifier is defined as a resource in a [policy][policies] and describes a
set of _rules_ on how to create new flow labels based on request metadata.
Aperture uses Envoy's [External Authorization][ext-authz] definition to describe
the request metadata (more specifically, the [AttributeContext][attr-context]).
The [INPUT section at this Rego playground][rego-playground] is an example how
the request attributes may look like.

:::note

At _feature_ [Control Points][control-point] developers already can provide
arbitrary flow labels â€“ either by setting baggage, or directly as arguments to
the `Check()` call. Since at feature control points flow labels can be easily
controlled, classifiers are available only on at _traffic_ control points.

:::

Flow Labels created via Classifier are immediately available for use in other
components at the same [Control Point][control-point]. The Flow Label is also
injected as baggage, so it will be available on every subsequent control point
too (assuming you have [baggage propagation][baggage] configured in your
system). If you're a [FluxNinja ARC plugin][plugin] user, such flow label will
also be available in the Cloud for analytics.

:::note

Both these behaviours (baggage propagation and inclusion in telemetry) can be
[disabled][rule].

:::

:::caution

Although Classifier is defined as a resource in a [policy][policies], Flow
Labels are not namespaced in any way.

:::

## Selector

Each classifier needs to specify which control point it will be run at. For
instance, the following selector is for the "ingress" control point at a
service:

```yaml
selector:
  service_selector:
    service: service1.default.svc.cluster.local
  flow_selector:
    control_point: ingress
```

You can be more precise by adding a [label matcher][label-matcher] and e.g. gate
the classifier to particular paths.

## Live Previewing Requests

You can discover the request attributes flowing through services and control
points using the
[Introspection API](references/api/agent/flow-preview-service-preview-http-requests.api.mdx)
on an `aperture-agent` local to the service instances (pods).

For example:

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:8080/v1/flowcontrol/preview/http_requests/service1-demo-app.demoapp.svc.cluster.local/ingress?samples=1
```

Returns:

```json

## Rules ([reference][rule]) {#rules}

In addition to the selector, a classifier needs to specify classification rules.
Each classification rule consists of:

- flow label key,
- a rule how to extract the flow label value based on request metadata.

There are two ways to specify a classification rule: using declarative
extractors and [rego][rego] modules. [See examples in reference][rule].

:::caution Request body availability

Possibility of extracting values from request body depends on how [External
Authorization in Envoy][ext-authz-extension] was configured. Sample [Istio
Configuration][install-istio] provided by FluxNinja doesn't enable request body
buffering by default, as it _might_ break some streaming APIs.

:::

### Extractors ([reference][extractor]) {#extractors}

Extractors are declarative recipes how to extract flow label value from
metadata. Provided extractors include:

- extracting values from headers,
- grabbing a field from json-encoded request payload,
- parsing JWT tokens,
- and others.

Aperture aims to expand the set of extractors to cover most-common usecases.

:::caution

Keys of flow labels created by extractors must be valid [Rego][rego] identifiers
(allowed are alphanumeric characters and underscore; also label name cannot be a
[Rego keyword][rego-kw], like `if` or `default`). This limitation may be lifted
in future.

:::

:::note

Extracting value from header may seem not useful, as the value is already
available as flow label ([as `http.request.header.<header>`][request-labels]),
but adding flow label explicitly may still be useful, as it enables baggage
propagation and telemetry for this flow label.

:::

### Rego ([reference][rego-rule]) {#rego}

For more advanced cases, you can define the extractor in [the Rego
language][rego].
