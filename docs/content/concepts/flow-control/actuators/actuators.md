TODO What are actuators in general?

An actuator is a component of a policy circuit that is responsible for moving
and controlling a traffic flow at a specified control point, for example by load
shedding certain types of traffic at a given control point. In simple terms, it
takes the load shed factor input signal and publishes it to the schedulers to
actuate.

TODO when to choose:

- [scheduler](scheduler.md)
- [rate limiter](rate-limiter.md)
