Aperture comes with a pre-packaged list of policies that can be used both as a
guide for creating new policies; and as ready-to-use blueprints.

Policy-as-a-circuit is a method of defining and managing reliability criteria,
and conditions through code. It's a way of enforcing reliability policies
programmatically, running in a continuous control loop. In an application
reliability context, it codifies the capability of the application to modify its
operation to achieve the best possible mode of operation during cascading
failures of service.

There are two kinds of policies:

- Rate Limiting
- Concurrency Control
