Aperture is free and open-source software that is dually licensed:

- [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) (GNU
  GPLv3): In simple terms, it requires enhancements (modifications) made to
  Aperture be released to the community. If you are not making modifications
  (99% users) to Aperture, there is nothing more to be done to meet the
  obligation of this license.

- Enterprise License: Customers of FluxNinja are provided Aperture under
  commercial license terms that bypass obligations of GNU GPLv3. Please contact
  us at [sales@fluxninja.com](mailto:sales@fluxninja.com) to learn more.

There can be some questions regarding the terms of GNU GPLv3 license and we hope
the below FAQ helps.

## Can I ship/use Aperture with my proprietary software or SaaS application?

Yes, you are free to commercialize unmodified version of the software in any way
you choose. If you are distributing modified Aperture in binary form then you
must provide those modifications.

## Do I need to worry about GNU GPLv3 when using a commercially licensed version of Aperture?

No, you can use or distribute commercially licensed Aperture in any way you like
and even make proprietary modifications.
