The Aperture Agent can be installed using the Kubernetes Operator available for
it.

:::info

This method requires access to create cluster level resources such as
ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, CustomResourceDefinition and so on.

Use the
[Namespace-scoped Installation](/aperture-for-infra/agent/kubernetes/namespace-scoped/namespace-scoped.md)
if you do not want to assign the cluster level permissions.
