The easiest way to install Aperture is to install just Aperture Agents and point
them to [FluxNinja][], which also [provides the Aperture
Controller][Cloud Controller].

If you want to have control over the infrastructure and data, it's also possible
to self-host your own Aperture Controller. In such a setup, Agents and
Controller comprise a fully functional Aperture system.

Note that [FluxNinja can integrate][extension-config] with Self-Hosted
Controller too, providing an easy way to manage policies and a holistic view of
the infrastructure, along with tools for OLAP analysis of traffic.
