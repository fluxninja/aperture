The easiest way to install Aperture is to install just Aperture Agents and point
them to [FluxNinja][], which also provides the Aperture Controller.

If you want to have control over the infrastructure and data, it's also possible
to self-host your own Aperture Controller. In such a setup, Agents and
Controller comprise a fully functional Aperture system.

Note that [FluxNinja][] can integrate with self-hosted controller too, providing
an easy way to manage policies and a holistic view of the infrastructure, along
with tools for OLAP analysis of traffic.
