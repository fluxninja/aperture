Usually, Aperture Agents are the only required Aperture component to be
installed. In such setup, Agents are connecting to [FluxNinja ARC][].

If you want to have control over the infrastructure and data, it's also possible
to self-host your own Aperture Controller. In such setup Agents and Controller
comprise a fully functional Aperture system.

Note that [FluxNinja ARC][] can integrate with self-hosted controller too,
providing a visual way to manage policies and view the infrastructure, along
with tools for OLAP analysis of traffic.
