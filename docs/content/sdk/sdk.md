For services to control flows with Aperture Agent, [Control
Points][control-point] must be set within the service. Aperture SDKs can be used
to set feature or traffic (HTTP and gRPC) control points within the service
code. This approach allows for fine-grained flow control.

<a
href={`https://github.com/fluxninja/aperture/tree/${apertureVersion}/sdks/`}>Aperture
SDKs</a> are available for popular languages:

- [Golang][golang]
- [Java][java]
- [JavaScript][javascript]
- [Python][python]
- [.NET][dotnet]

Aperture SDK allows you to manually wrap any function call or code snippet
inside the service code as a feature control point. Every invocation of the
feature is a flow from the perspective of Aperture.

## ðŸ§© Middleware

Aperture includes middleware for the following frameworks, helping to set up
control points with less code changes:

- [Armeria][armeria]
- [Netty][netty]
- [Tomcat][tomcat]
- [Spring Boot][spring-boot]
