```

To simplify the process of creating policies in Aperture Cloud, it includes UI
Policy Builder. Providing several [blueprints][blueprints] that can help you
generate [policies][policies] according to the use case. These blueprints serve
as starting points for creating new policies, or can be used as-is by providing
the required parameters or customizations.
