  title: "Flow Control"
  description: Flow control in Aperture refers to the mechanism of regulating the flow of requests in a web-scale application to ensure stability and reliability. Aperture uses a combination of techniques such as weighted fair queuing, distributed rate-limiting, and prioritization of critical features to manage the flow of requests and prevent overloading. It also uses dataflow-driven policies and a programmable, high-fidelity flow classifier to make decisions about how to handle requests and prioritize workloads.
