To deploy Aperture with Aperture Cloud, it's enough to install Aperture Agents.

It is recommended to install `aperturectl` CLI as it can help with installation
of Agents and managing policies.

:::note

If _not_ using Aperture Cloud, a [Self-Hosted][Self-Hosting] Aperture Controller
also needs to be installed.
