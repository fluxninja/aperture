To deploy Aperture with FluxNinja Cloud, it's enough to install Aperture Agents.

We also recommend installing aperturectl CLI. It can help with installation of
Agents, and also will be needed to manage the policies.

:::note

If _not_ using FluxNinja Cloud, a [Self-Hosted][Self-Hosting] Aperture
Controller also needs to be installed.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
```
