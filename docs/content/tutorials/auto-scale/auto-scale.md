Here are a few example policies for performing auto scale.
[_Auto Scaler_](reference/policies/spec.md#auto-scaler) is the high-level
component for performing auto scale via Aperture. Multiple Controllers can be
defined on the _Auto Scaler_ for performing scale-out or scale-in. The _Auto
Scaler_ can interface with infrastructure APIs such as Kubernetes to perform
auto scale.
