We also have some tutorials that you can follow to solve different use-cases.

## Signal Processing

Let's understand how to build policies tailored to your needs. For example, in
one of the tutorials, we'll see how to detect overload using metrics passed
through policy components, resulting in corrective actions.

- [Writing Policy for Detecting Overload](./signal-processing/detecting-overload.md)

## Integrations

Aperture offers various integrations, with Flow Control being one of them. Let's
see what you can do with flow control.

### Flow Control

- [GraphQL Query Static Rate Limiting](./integrations/flow-control/classification/graphql-rate-limiting.md)
- [Static Rate Limiting](./integrations/flow-control/rate-limiting/static-rate-limiting.md)
- [Dynamic Rate Limiting](./integrations/flow-control/rate-limiting/dynamic-rate-limiting.md)
- [Basic Concurrency Limiting](./integrations/flow-control/concurrency-limiting/basic-concurrency-limiting.md)
- [Workload Prioritization](./integrations/flow-control/concurrency-limiting/workload-prioritization.md)
