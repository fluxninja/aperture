## What is Aperture?

<!-- vale on -->

The [FluxNinja Aperture](https://github.com/fluxninja/aperture) project, an open
source Intelligent Load Management platform that seamlessly integrates into any
tech stack. This innovative platform is built to empower developers, platform
engineers, and reliability engineers, providing them with an advanced control
mechanism dovetailed with an observability layer. Aperture streamlines the task
of handling diverse traffic load intensities, spanning from low throughput
instances to conditions necessitating web-scale capacities.

Aperture's cutting-edge features enable teams to effortlessly implement
intelligent load management strategies, ensuring optimal performance and maximal
infrastructure utilization optimal end-user experience, even during service
failures. This versatility and resilience apply across all types of systems,
including monolithic architectures and distributed microservices environments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Load management capabilities

Aperture offers a suite of intelligent load management capabilities that are
applicable to a wide range of cloud-native applications. These capabilities
ensure the reliability and stability of applications, and include:

- üõ°Ô∏è
  [**Adaptive Service Protection**](./use-cases/service-protection/basic-service-protection.md):
  Enhance resource utilization and safeguard against abrupt service overloads
  with an intelligent queue at the entry point of services. This queue
  dynamically adjusts the rate of requests based on live service health, thereby
  mitigating potential service disruptions and ensuring optimal performance
  under all load conditions.
- üìä
  [**Intelligent Quota Management**](./use-cases/quota-scheduler/quota-scheduler.md):
  Maintain compliance with external API quotas with a global token bucket and
  smart request queuing. This feature regulates requests aimed at external
  services, ensuring that the usage remains within prescribed rate limits and
  avoids penalties or additional costs.
- üéØ
  [**Workload Prioritization**](./use-cases/service-protection/workload-prioritization.md):
  Safeguard crucial user experience pathways and ensure prioritized access to
  external APIs even during high-load conditions by strategically prioritizing
  workloads. This is achieved through the use of declarative policies that label
  and prioritize workload requests, such as API calls. By employing
  [weighted fair queuing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_fair_queueing)
  for scheduling, Aperture ensures a fair distribution of resources that aligns
  with the business value and urgency of requests.
- üîÄ [**Load based Auto Scaling**](./use-cases/auto-scale/auto-scale.md):
  Eliminate the need for costly over-provisioning and enhance efficiency with
  Aperture's load-based auto-scaling. Aperture's policies are expressed as
  circuit graphs that continuously track deviations from service-level
  objectives and calculate recovery or escalation actions. Auto-scaling can be
  implemented as an escalation that triggers based on load throttling signal.
- ‚è±Ô∏è
  [**Distributed Rate-Limiting**](./use-cases/rate-limiting/rate-limiting.md):
  Safeguard APIs from potential abuse with Aperture's high-performance,
  distributed rate limiter. This feature enforces per-key limits based on
  fine-grained labels, ensuring precise control and prevention of excessive
  usage.
- üöÄ
  [**Automated Load Ramping**](./use-cases/feature-rollout/feature-rollout.md):
  Aperture enables teams to gradually release new features to a subset of users,
  without impacting the rest of the system, using dark launch.

## üõ†Ô∏è How it works

Load management, at its core, consists of a control loop that observes,
analyzes, and actuates workloads to ensure the stability and reliability of
cloud-native applications.

This control loop is pivotal in both flow control and auto-scaling use cases. In
flow control, the loop manages workloads to maintain the system within its
capacity. In auto-scaling scenarios, the control loop adjusts resource
allocation in response to demand and performance fluctuations.

During the observation phase, an in-built telemetry system continuously monitors
service performance and request attributes, allowing the agent and controller to
make informed decisions about request handling and workload prioritization.

The analysis and actuation phases use
[**Declarative policies**](./concepts/policy/policy.md) that facilitates teams
in defining responses to different situations, such as deviations from
service-level objectives.

When defining a policy, these are some key components to consider:
[**Control Point**](./concepts/flow-control/selector.md) ‚Üí Needed to guide flow
control based decisions. [**Selector**](./concepts/flow-control/selector.md) ‚Üí
Needed to select the flow that the policy should consider.
[**Classifier**](./concepts/flow-control/resources/classifier.md). ‚Üí Create
additional Flow Labels based on request metadata, collectively enriching the
policy's operational capability.
