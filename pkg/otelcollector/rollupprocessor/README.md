# Rollup processor

Supported pipeline types: traces, logs.

The rollup processor accepts traces or logs and rolls them up, based on
attributes.

It is highly recommended to configure batch processor just before rollup
processor. Rollup processor rolls up traces or logs which are a part of one
message.

## Configuration

```yaml
processors:
  batch/prerollup:
    timeout: 1s
    send_batch_size: 10000
  rollup:
    rollups:
      - from: body_size
        to: body_size_min
        type: min
      - from: body_size
        to: body_size_max
        type: max
      - from: body_size
        to: body_size_sum
        type: sum
```

| Field name     | Type       | Required | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `rollups`      | `[]Rollup` | No       | Array of rollups. One per resulting rolled up field. |
| `rollups.from` | `string`   | Yes      | Field from which value to be rolled up is read.      |
| `rollups.to`   | `string`   | Yes      | Field to which rolled up value is written.           |
| `rollups.type` | `string`   | Yes      | Rollup type. See below for possible values.          |

### Rollup types

| Type name | From type | To type | Description            |
| --------- | --------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| `min`     | `string`  | `int64` | Returns minimum value. |
| `max`     | `string`  | `int64` | Returns maximum value. |
| `sum`     | `string`  | `int64` | Returns sum of values. |

## Design

Rollup processor is basically merging maps. In order to merge two maps, they
need to have the same _key attribues_. Key attribute is an attribute which was
not specified as rollup attribute in the configuration i.e. was not specified in
any of `rollups.from` fields.

Merging of such maps results with a map with key attributes and rollup result
attributes. In addition, there is `rollup_count` attribute, which describes how
many maps were rolled up into this single result. Please refer to the example
below to fully understand.

### Example

Assume the rollup processor is configured with config given in the previous
section. On the input we have following maps (they are parts of either Traces of
Logs).

```json
[
  { "path": "/foo", "user-agent": "fizz", "body_size": "5" },
  { "path": "/foo", "user-agent": "fizz", "body_size": "6" },
  { "path": "/bar", "user-agent": "fizz", "body_size": "7" }
]
```

This will result in:

```json
[
  {
    "path": "/foo",
    "user-agent": "fizz",
    "body_size_min": 5,
    "body_size_max": 6,
    "body_size_sum": 11,
    "rollup_count": 2
  },
  {
    "path": "/bar",
    "user-agent": "fizz",
    "body_size_min": 7,
    "body_size_max": 7,
    "body_size_sum": 7,
    "rollup_count": 1
  }
]
```
